<title>About the Cover Art</title>

<p dk:indent='no'>
On June 28, 1778, two years after American Independence had been
declared, a young woman made her way through the sweltering heat of a
Revolutionary battlefield carrying pitchers of water to heat-weakened
men.  Mary Ludwig Hays - "Molly Pitcher," as
she was called - looked up to see that one of the men who had fallen
from heatstroke was her own husband, John.  She resolutely made her
way to his cannon just as an officer was preparing to order it retired
for want of a gunner.  Setting down her pitchers, Molly picked up the
ramrod and took her husband's place at the muzzle.</p>

<p>The story of the woman gunner was told and retold by the
soldiers of the Revolution, and "Molly Pitcher" became a legend around
battlefield campfires.  She came to symbolize all of the women who
took up arms for American Independence.</p>

<p>During the war, General George Washington made Mary Hays a
sergeant, and afterward she was pensioned as a lieutenant by the
Continental Army.  Mary Hays lived into her 70s and is buried in
Carlisle, PA.</p>
