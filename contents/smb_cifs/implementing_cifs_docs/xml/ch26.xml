<p>The first time you visit a foreign country, things may seem
strange and even a bit daunting. After a while, however, the
scenery starts to become familiar, the customs seem less
surprising, and even the rhythm of the language starts to feel
comfortable.</p>

<p>The Browse Service is a complex system built on top of a complex
set of protocols. It can also seem strange and daunting at first.
Now that you have travelled through it and spent some time getting
to know the inhabitants, you should feel much more at home.</p>

<p>By studying the Browse Service,<idx>Browse Service</idx> we have
also managed to provide an introduction to some of the more difficult
sub-systems in the CIFS protocol suite - things like Named Pipes and
SMB transactions.  Understanding these is a prerequisite to dealing
with the more advanced topics and sub-protocols that we have so
carefully avoided.</p>

<p>Coverage of the Browse Service concludes our study of CIFS.
Between the information presented here, the suggested references, and a
good protocol analyzer there is more than enough information
available to build a solid CIFS client implementation and probably
a working server - but you won't really know until you try.</p>

<p>Welcome to the Network Neighborhood.<idx>Network Neighborhood</idx></p>
